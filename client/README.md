Name of Project: SoulFly Yoga
Brief:    
	Yoga can be a method to heal one‚Äôs body and mind simultaneously. However, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to yoga, and what works for one person may not work for another.  This app will allow users to create their own yoga routines based on their individual needs and goals. Users will be able to set their intention for the yoga routine, select poses to cycle through, and decide how many times to cycle through the poses. The app will also track the user's progress and allow them to comment on how they felt after each session and if the routine was something they would repeat in the future.
	
This app will help users to:
Find the right yoga poses for their needs
Track their progress over time
Stay motivated to practice yoga regularly
View other yogis routines

I believe that this app will be a valuable tool for people who are looking to heal their bodies and minds through yoga. The CRUD operations will allow users to easily create, read, update, and delete their yoga routines. This will make it easy for users to find the right yoga poses for their needs, track their progress over time, and stay motivated to practice yoga regularly.

App Summary üëç 

Overview of app: 
The app addresses the challenge of finding a personalized and effective yoga routine that caters to the individual needs and goals of each user. Many people struggle to discover the right yoga poses and routines that align with their unique issues in need of healing-both mentally and physically.
Users can create custom yoga routines by setting intentions, selecting poses, and determining the number of pose cycles. They can also track their progress, leave comments on each session, and review other yogis' routines for inspiration. This app combines my passion for yoga and software development, allowing me to create a meaningful and impactful tool that supports individuals on their journey to physical and mental well-being. I hope to contribute to the enhancement of people's lives through the practice of yoga.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
